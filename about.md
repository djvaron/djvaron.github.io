I'm a postdoctoral researcher working with Daniel Jacob in the [Atmospheric Chemistry Modeling Group](http://acmg.seas.harvard.edu/) at Harvard. I focus on satellite remote sensing of greenhouse gases. Please see my <a href="{{ site.url }}/research">research page</a> or <a href="{{ site.url }}/djvcv.pdf">CV</a> for more information. 

I was born and raised in Montr&#233;al, Qu&#233;bec, and studied physics and English literature at McGill before coming to Harvard. 

<!--In my spare time, I enjoy reading (especially science fiction), hiking, and---most of all---playing piano.-->
