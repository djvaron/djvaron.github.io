### Enabling easy access to analytical inversions of TROPOMI methane observations on the cloud

We built a user-friendly cloud-computing tool for researchers and stakeholders to estimate high-resolution regional methane emissions by inversion of TROPOMI satellite data. See [our paper](https://acmg.seas.harvard.edu/files/acmg/files/varon2022.pdf) in review at GMD for the details.

### Monitoring methane point sources with multispectral Sentinel-2 satellite observations

We demonstrated the previously undocumented capability of the Sentinel-2 twin satellites (and Landsat) to detect and quantify anomalous methane point sources. See [our paper](https://amt.copernicus.org/articles/14/2771/2021/amt-14-2771-2021.html) in AMT for the details.

### Estimating methane emissions from individual coal mine vents using GHGSat-D satellite observations

We estimated time-averaged methane emissions from underground coal mines in the United States, China, and Australia by aggregating [GHGSat-D observations](https://www.ghgsat.com/data-products-analytics/analytics/) in time. Check out our [2020 ES&T paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.est.0c01213) for the full story.

### Monitoring anomalous methane point sources in oil/gas fields with satellites

We quantified massive methane point sources in an oil/gas field using the [GHGSat-D](https://www.ghgsat.com/who-we-are/our-satellites/claire/) and [TROPOMI](http://www.tropomi.eu/) satellite instruments. This was a collaboration between Harvard, GHGSat, and the SRON Netherlands Institute for Space Research. Read more about it in our [2019 GRL paper](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2019GL083798).

### Deep learning for detecting methane plumes in noisy satellite imagery

We're training convolutional neural networks to localize methane plumes in noisy GHGSat satellite observations.

### Source rate retrieval algorithms for quantifying methane point sources from space

We developed algorithms for retrieving emission rates from fine-resolution satellite observations of atmospheric methane plumes. You can read more about them in our [2018 AMT paper](https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-11-5673-2018).

I'm interested in what satellite remote sensing can teach us about planetary atmospheres. 

This topic is on the interface between astrophysics and atmospheric science, the fields of my previous research. In the simplest terms, I am fascinated by the idea that we can learn new (and obscure!) things about a planet, just by looking at it from space.

Satellite instruments have the unique ability to characterize entire planetary atmospheres in a matter of hours or days. As a result, they grant access to an abundance of information about the Earth and other planets that would otherwise be out of reach to us---but only if they can be reliably interpreted. Fortunately (or unfortunately, depending on how you look at it) the scientific value of satellite data is often mostly limited by our powers of interpretation, and there is still a great deal of progress to be made in this regard. 

Interpreting satellite data is an inverse problem; you start with some measurements of a system and attempt to deduce what the state of the system must have been for you to have made those measurements. Often the problem is under-determined; there may not be a unique state that produces your measurements. However, as outlined in Clive D. Rodgers' textbook [<em>Inverse Methods for Atmospheric Sounding</em>](https://books.google.com/books/about/Inverse_Methods_for_Atmospheric_Sounding.html?id=dW-0QgAACAAJ&redir_esc=y), it is possible to determine the most likely state of the system via Bayesian minimization of a cost function. 

When the system under scrutiny is an atmosphere and the measurements come from a satellite, there are two inverse problems that are of special interest to me. The first is the problem of inferring the global distribution of a trace gas from the satellite spectra, in which case the goal is to determine the concentrations of the gas at different locations around the planet, given some knowledge of how light interacts with chemicals in the atmosphere. The second is the problem of constraining emissions of the trace gas, given the map of concentrations produced in the first problem and a chemical transport model. I plan to explore both of these problems in depth during my PhD.
