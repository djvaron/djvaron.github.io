From 2011 to 2013, I did climate physics research with [Professor Shaun Lovejoy](http://www.physics.mcgill.ca/~gang/Lovejoy.htm) at McGill. We looked at predictions from four general circulation models of global temperature fluctuations on different time scales, from hours to centuries. 

We found that while last-millennium simulations underestimated temperature variability in control runs, they were more realistic in the industrial period when including external forcings (<em>e.g.</em>, volcanic or solar). In pre-industrial scenarios, however, multicentennial variability appeared to be underestimated, possibly due to a lack of certain slow climate processes, like land ice, in the models. If you're interested in learning more, take a look at our paper: [Do GCMs predict the climate... or macroweather?](http://www.earth-syst-dynam.net/4/439/2013/esd-4-439-2013.html)

In principle, one should expect to see relatively large variability at time scales comparable to the lifetimes of typical weather systems (on the order of a few hours or days). Zooming out to the scale of months or a few years, however, and removing seasonal trends, variability should decline as fluctuations due to weather average out. Finally, on time scales from decades to centuries and millennia, temperature variability must rise again to reflect long-term trends (e.g., glacial-interglacial cycling). Professor Lovejoy calls these scaling regimes "weather," "macroweather," and "climate," respectively. Each of them has different statistical properties:

Each time series is 720 points long, has had its mean subtracted, and is normalized by its standard deviation. Resolutions from bottom to top are 0.067 seconds, 1 hour, 20 days, and 100 years.

We wanted to know how well different GCMs could capture these scaling statistics, so we took a variety of temperature time series from four different models---the coupled ocean-atmosphere model [ECHO-G](http://www.ipcc-data.org/ar4/model-CONS-ECHO-G-change.html); the Max Planck Institute Earth System Model ([MPI-ESM](http://www.mpimet.mpg.de/en/science/models/mpi-esm.html)); the Goddard Institute for Space Studies model ([GISS-E2-R](http://data.giss.nasa.gov/modelE/ar5/)); and NOAA's 20th-Century Reanalysis model ([20CR](http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/20thC_Rean/))---and plotted the characteristic magnitudes of their fluctuations against time scale.
